Front-End-Carousel
==================

This is a wrapper around jCarousel 0.3. It extends jCarousel with the following
features:

* Responsive support with configurable breakpoints
* `overflow: scroll` support
* Lazy-loading images as they come into view
* Touch scrolling (both finger-tracking and swipe support)
* Auto disabling of next/previous controls
* Fixes existing jCarousel edge case bugs
* And more - like easy event binding, `created` deferred, et. al.
