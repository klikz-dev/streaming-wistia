  "readme": "# node-stripe\n\nThis is a wrapper around Stripe to make SVOD easier.\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar stripe = require('node-stripe');\nstripe.init('SECRET_KEY', {\n  // options\n});\n\n// Retrieve all plans\nstripe.getAllPlans().then(function(plans) {\n  // plans is an array of stripe.models.Plan models\n});\n\n// The underlying Stripe library is accessible under the `lib` property:\nstripe.lib.plan.list().then(function(plans) {\n});\n```\n\nTODO: document this more.\n\n## Notes\n\n# Subscriptions are based on tags\n# This lib expects each plan to have the following metadata fields:\n`subscriber_count`, `tags`, `type[svod|tvod]`\n# Each customer is created with a `foreignKey` metadata field\n# Both SVOD and TVOD are achieved by subscribing users to plans. If a plan is of\ntype=tvod, it must also have a $0 currency with one-time amount in a custom\nmetadata field titled `tvod_amount`. The user will be subscribed to the plan and\na charge will created with the amount in the `tvod_amount` metadata field.\n\nThis is somewhat hacky but Stripe doesn't support the notion of one-time payments\nto a plan. That said, there are three advantages to this setup: 1) Stripe remains\nthe source of truth for packages and entitlements, 2) entitlements can be revoked\nby cancelling the subscription, and 3) the code to support both SVOD and TVOD are 99% the same.\n\n## TODO\n\n* Support coupon codes for TVOD plans. The charge amount needs to be calculated manually.\n\n\n## Tests\n\nThere are some basic tests in the `test/` directory, broken down by modules. You can use the command `npm test` to run them all. Alternatively, you can add any tests you don't want to run to the `test/other/` directory and it will be ignored.\n",
